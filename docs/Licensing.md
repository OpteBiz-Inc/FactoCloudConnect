# Licensing and activation

## How Licensing Works
Like Ignition, FactoCloudConnect is licensed by the Ignition server, not the client. only you need one license for your Ignition server; any clients are automatically included. FactoCloudConnect license is unlimited so you don't have to worry about running into limits after purchase.

FactoCloudConnect works on a combination of two licenses.

## Effective Ignition License
Ignition Product license purchased from Inductive Automation and valid at the time of Factogrid Installation. 

## FactoCloudConnect License
Third Party FactoCloudConnect License key installed on the same gateway.

## Please Note
* Valid Ignition License should be effective on the gateway at the time of installing or running FactoCloudConnect
* Application will stop working if the Ignition License expires or is invalidated irrespective of the license status of FactoCloudConnect
* A trial version of the license can be downloaded from the https://inductiveautomation.com/moduleshowcase/ Third-Party Module Showcase to evaluate the product.  Trial version will automatically expire after two hours post which it may be reset for another two hours for evaluation.
* Any unauthorized copying or distribution of the license is prohibited.
